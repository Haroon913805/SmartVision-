# SmartVision-
SmartVision-YOLO is a lightweight Python project that demonstrates object detection in images using the pretrained YOLOv5s model. Built using PyTorch and OpenCV, it allows users to detect multiple objects with high accuracy and minimal setup.
üîç Features:

Real-time object detection on images

Uses YOLOv5s pretrained model

Clean and minimal code structure

Easy to extend for video support or custom training
